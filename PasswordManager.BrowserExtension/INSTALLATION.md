## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading

**Issue**: Extension doesn't appear in Chrome extensions list
- **Solution**: Make sure you selected the correct folder containing `manifest.json`
- **Check**: Verify all required files are present in the extension folder

### No Icons Appearing

**Issue**: Icons don't show up on login forms
- **Solution 1**: Refresh the webpage after installing the extension
- **Solution 2**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Solution 3**: Ensure the website doesn't block content scripts (check CSP headers)

### Connection Issues

**Issue**: "Connection failed" or login errors
- **Solution 1**: Verify API URL in extension settings
- **Solution 2**: Check if Password Manager API is running (`http://localhost:5000`)
- **Solution 3**: Check browser console for CORS or network errors
- **Solution 4**: Ensure the API accepts requests from `chrome-extension://` origins

### Authentication Problems

**Issue**: Login fails with correct credentials
- **Solution 1**: Try the API endpoint directly in browser
- **Solution 2**: Check API logs for authentication errors
- **Solution 3**: Verify the login endpoint URL (should be `/api/authentication/login`)

### Icons Interfering with Website

**Issue**: Extension icons overlap with website elements
- **Solution**: The extension uses high z-index values to avoid conflicts
- **Report**: If you find specific websites with conflicts, report them for fixes

## Using the Extension

1. **Navigate to Login Page**: Visit any website with login forms
2. **Click Username Icon** (üë§): Shows matching credentials for the current domain
3. **Select Credential**: Click on a credential to autofill both username and password
4. **Submit Form**: Continue with your normal login process

2. **Select "Generate New Password"**: Opens password generator
3. **Customize Options**: Adjust length, character types in extension popup
4. **Generate and Fill**: Password is generated and filled into the field

1. **Open Extension Popup**: Click the extension icon
2. **Browse Credentials**: Use the Credentials tab to view and search
3. **Search**: Type in the search box to filter credentials
4. **Fill Manually**: Click any credential to fill it into the current tab

## Security Notes

- **No Local Storage**: Extension doesn't store passwords locally
- **API Communication**: All data comes from your secure Password Manager API
- **Encryption**: Uses the same security model as your main app
- **Permissions**: Extension only accesses current tab and storage

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom API Endpoints

If your Password Manager API uses different endpoints:

1. Modify `background.js` in the extension folder
2. Update the API endpoint URLs:
   - Login: `/api/authentication/login`
   - Get Items: `/api/passworditems`
   - Health Check: `/api/passworditems` (for connection test)

### HTTPS Configuration

For production use with HTTPS:

1. Update API URL in extension settings to use `https://`
2. Ensure your Password Manager API has valid SSL certificates
3. Update `host_permissions` in `manifest.json` if needed

### Cross-Origin Issues

If you encounter CORS issues:

1. Configure your Password Manager API to allow extension origins
2. Add `chrome-extension://*` to allowed origins in API CORS settings

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Press F12 and look for error messages
2. **Verify API Status**: Ensure Password Manager API is running and accessible
3. **Test Connection**: Use the "Test Connection" button in extension settings
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the extension has necessary permissions

## Updating the Extension

To update the extension:

1. **Download New Version**: Get the updated extension files
2. **Replace Files**: Replace files in your extension folder
3. **Reload Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find the extension, and click the reload icon

The extension will automatically preserve your settings and login status across updates.
