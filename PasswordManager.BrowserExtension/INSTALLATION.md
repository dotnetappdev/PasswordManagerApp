# Password Manager Browser Extension - Installation Guide

## Quick Setup for Direct Database Access

This guide will help you complete the setup of the Password Manager browser extension to work with SQLite database files directly.

### Prerequisites

- Password Manager application with a created database file
- Chrome/Chromium-based browser (Chrome 88+, Edge 88+)
- Access to download external libraries

### Step 1: Download Required Libraries

The extension needs SQL.js to read SQLite database files. Download the required files:

```bash
# Navigate to the extension directory
cd PasswordManager.BrowserExtension/lib/

# Download SQL.js library (replace placeholder file)
curl -L https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/sql.js/1.8.0/sql-wasm.js -o sql-wasm.js

# Download SQL.js WebAssembly module  
curl -L https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/sql.js/1.8.0/sql-wasm.wasm -o sql-wasm.wasm
```

**Alternative: Manual Download**
1. Visit https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/sql.js/1.8.0/
2. Download `sql-wasm.js` and `sql-wasm.wasm`
3. Place both files in the `PasswordManager.BrowserExtension/lib/` folder

### Step 2: Install Browser Extension

#### Chrome/Chromium Browsers:
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `PasswordManager.BrowserExtension` folder
5. Extension will appear in your browser toolbar

#### Firefox (Alternative):
1. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
3. Select the `manifest.json` file from the extension folder

### Step 3: Prepare Your Database

1. **Create Database**: Use the main Password Manager application to create your database
2. **Add Credentials**: Add some login credentials through the main app
3. **Note Database Location**: Remember where your database file is saved (usually `.db` or `.sqlite`)

### Step 4: First Use

1. **Click Extension Icon**: Look for the Password Manager icon in your browser toolbar
2. **Load Database**: 
   - Click "Load Database" on the first screen
   - Select your Password Manager database file (.db/.sqlite/.sal)
   - Click "Load Database" button
3. **Authenticate**:
   - Enter the same email you use in the main app
   - Enter your master password
   - Click "Unlock"

### Step 5: Test Functionality

1. **Visit a Website**: Go to any website with a login form
2. **Look for Icons**: You should see üë§ and üîë icons next to username/password fields
3. **Test Autofill**: Click the username icon to see your stored credentials
4. **Select Credential**: Click on a credential to auto-fill the form

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to load database"**
- Ensure you downloaded the SQL.js files correctly
- Check that your database file isn't corrupted
- Verify the file has a .db, .sqlite, or .sal extension

**"Authentication failed"**
- Double-check your email address (must match exactly)
- Verify your master password is correct
- Ensure the database was created with the same user

**No icons appear on websites**
- Refresh the page after installing the extension
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Verify the extension has necessary permissions

**"No credentials found"**
- Ensure you have login items stored for the current website
- Check that the website URL matches what you saved
- Try clicking "View All" to see all credentials

### Developer Console

If issues persist, check the browser console:
1. Press F12 to open developer tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for Password Manager related errors
4. Check for SQL.js loading errors

### Permissions

Ensure the extension has these permissions:

- ‚úÖ `unlimitedStorage` - For large database files
- ‚úÖ `notifications` - For user feedback

## Security Notes

- **Database Files**: Keep your database files secure and backed up
- **Master Password**: Never share your master password
- **Browser Storage**: Extension only stores authentication state, not passwords
- **Local Operation**: All decryption happens locally - no data sent to servers

## File Verification

After setup, verify these files exist:

```
PasswordManager.BrowserExtension/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sql-wasm.js              # ‚úÖ Should be ~150KB
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sql-wasm.wasm            # ‚úÖ Should be ~400KB
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database-service.js          # ‚úÖ Database operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crypto-service.js            # ‚úÖ Encryption/decryption
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js                # ‚úÖ Updated for database access
