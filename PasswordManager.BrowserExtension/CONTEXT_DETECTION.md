# 1Password-like Context Detection Implementation

This document describes the enhanced browser extension functionality that provides 1Password-like context detection and smart autofill behavior.

## Overview

The browser extension now intelligently detects form contexts and automatically prioritizes the appropriate item types (passwords vs. credit cards) based on the form being filled, similar to how 1Password works.

## Key Features

### 1. Form Context Detection
- **Smart Analysis**: Forms are analyzed to determine their context:
  - `payment`: Forms with credit card fields and payment indicators
  - `login`: Forms with username/password fields  
  - `mixed`: Forms with both login and payment fields
  - `unknown`: Forms that don't match clear patterns

- **Context Indicators**: Uses multiple signals to determine form type:
  - Field types (credit card, password, email fields)
  - Form content (text mentioning "payment", "checkout", "billing", etc.)
  - Form attributes (class names, IDs, action URLs)

### 2. Context-Aware Item Prioritization
- **Payment Forms**: Automatically shows credit cards first when user clicks on payment fields
- **Login Forms**: Prioritizes showing saved credentials when user clicks on login fields  
- **Mixed Forms**: Shows relevant items based on which specific field type was clicked

### 3. Real-Time Context Switching
- **Field Focus Detection**: Monitors when users focus or click on form fields
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Automatically switches item suggestions based on focused field type
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows subtle indicators when fields are ready for autofill

### 4. 1Password-like Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Quick Access**: `Ctrl+\` (PC/Linux) or `Cmd+\` (Mac) for manual item selection
- **Context Aware**: Shortcut shows appropriate items based on currently focused field
- **Fallback**: Works even when automatic detection doesn't trigger

### 5. Web API Fallback Support
- **Dual Communication**: Tries native host first, falls back to web API if unavailable
- **Seamless Experience**: Users don't need to know which method is being used
- **Better Error Messages**: Informative error messages about connection issues

## Technical Implementation

### Form Context Detection
```javascript
analyzeFormContext(form) {
  // Analyzes field types, form content, and attributes
  // Returns: 'payment', 'login', 'mixed', or 'unknown'
}
```

### Smart Item Display
```javascript
showContextualPopup(field, items, formContext) {
  // Shows unified popup with prioritized items
  // Groups items by type with appropriate headers
}
```

### Field Focus Tracking
```javascript
handleFieldFocus(field) {
  // Tracks focused field for context switching
  // Adds visual indicators and logs context
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Payment Form
When clicking on a credit card field:
1. Extension detects form context as "payment"
2. Credit cards are shown first in the dropdown
3. Login credentials may also be available (for mixed forms)

### Login Form  
When clicking on a username/password field:
1. Extension detects form context as "login" 
2. Saved credentials are shown first
3. Password generation option is available for password fields

### Mixed Form
When clicking on different field types:
1. Credit card fields show credit cards first, then credentials
2. Login fields show credentials first, then credit cards
3. Context switches automatically as user moves between fields

## Testing

Use the test page `test-context-detection.html` to verify functionality:

1. **Login Form Section**: Should detect as "login" context
2. **Payment Form Section**: Should detect as "payment" context  
3. **Mixed Form Section**: Should detect as "mixed" context
4. **Unknown Form Section**: Should detect as "unknown" context

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Items appear automatically without manual searching
2. **Efficiency**: Relevant items are prioritized based on form context
3. **Flexibility**: Manual shortcuts available when auto-detection fails
4. **Reliability**: Web API fallback ensures extension works even without native host
5. **1Password Familiarity**: Behavior matches user expectations from 1Password

## Browser Extension Files Modified

- `content.js`: Added context detection, field focus tracking, keyboard shortcuts
- `background.js`: Added web API fallback support  
- `test-context-detection.html`: Comprehensive test page for validation

## Compatibility

- Works with existing native host implementation
- Backwards compatible with previous extension versions
- Supports both SQLite (native host) and web API data sources
- Compatible with Chrome/Chromium-based browsers
