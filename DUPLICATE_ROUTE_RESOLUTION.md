# Duplicate Route Resolution

## Problem
The application was experiencing duplicate route errors at runtime:

```
The following routes are ambiguous:
'home' in 'PasswordManager.App.Components.Pages.Home'
'home' in 'PasswordManager.Components.Shared.Pages.Home'
```

## Root Cause
Both the App project and the Components.Shared project contained Razor components with identical `@page` directives, causing Blazor's routing system to detect conflicts.

## Solution
Removed the `@page` directives from the shared components, making them non-routable while preserving them as reusable components:

### Changes Made:
1. **PasswordManager.Components.Shared/Pages/Home.razor**: Removed `@page "/home"`
2. **PasswordManager.Components.Shared/Pages/Login.razor**: Removed `@page "/login"` and `@page "/"`  
3. **PasswordManager.Components.Shared/Pages/Admin/UserManagement.razor**: Removed `@page "/admin/users"`

### Rationale:
- The App project components are more comprehensive (e.g., Home component: 2715 vs 2421 lines)
- App components include additional features like sync functionality
- The App.csproj already excludes shared page components, indicating intended architecture
- App components are the "most updated" versions as required

## Result
- ✅ No duplicate route conflicts
- ✅ App components handle all routing
- ✅ Shared components available as reusable components if needed
- ✅ Application should start without routing errors

## Architecture Note
The shared components library is intended for component reuse, not for routing. The main application (App project) should handle all route definitions to avoid conflicts.
